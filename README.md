# Collabify
## Description
Collabify is a discord bot designed to allow users to create collaborative playlists from a discord channel. Playlists are created and hosted on a central Spotify account as private collaborative playlists. There is a fork of this code that allows users to add songs from their personal accounts however this is not currently supported by the Spotify API.
## Installation
Collabify can be added to your server using the below link or run yourself. Ifd you are choosing to host your own Collabify you will need a spotify developer account. Once you have this an application can be created and the proper keys can be added to config.ini. An example layout of config.ini can be found in example.ini.
